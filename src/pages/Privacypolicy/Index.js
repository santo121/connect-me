        <p>Connect Media Networks is a digital marketing platform. We are providing this services privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform and related services (collectively, “Services”) process information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other entities that use our Services.</p>
        <p>Connect Media Networks runs a technology buying platform for digital media marketing. The Connect Media Networks technology allows our customers to buy social media management and SEO services. When the service is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the digital creatives like image posters, motion graphics and video (collectively, "Creatives") to Internet users who visit the respective social media websites. </p>
        <p>The Connect Media Networks Services are intended primarily for use by institutions like Christian Missionaries and Churches. We may also collect personal information from individuals who visit our websites, interact with our marketing messages and emails, or engage with us about career opportunities with ConnectMedia Networks.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>.</p>

        <h3>Privacy Practices for Our Technology</h3>
       

        <p>Advertising supports the free content and digital user experiences that we all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping our customers to display Creatives that may be of interest to you as a site user or visitor or as a registered member. We believe that relevant Creatives are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevance also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads, which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.</p>

        <h3 id="what-information">What Information We Collect, The Purpose of Collection and Use</h3>

        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        

        <p>We collect contact information through our technology from customers, who wish to obtain information or support, or to obtain access to our platform.

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
       

        <p>Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology to collect information such as your IP host address, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, number of links you click, search terms, and other data.

        <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
       

        <p>Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visits to websites or your viewing of ads.

        <h3>Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3>

        <h3>Onward Transfer to Third Parties</h3>
        
        <p>Connect Media Networks may share your information with its customers in connection with the offering of its Services. For example, a Connect Media Networks customer may receive a log of all creatives they served through our platform with data about your cookie and mobile advertising identifiers that interacted with the ads, including IP host addresses and other pseudonymous information in non-aggregated form. When we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR, any personal data for which a separate consent has not been received are pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with customers and are sufficiently protected as required by GDPR (see below for more information about how we handle the transfer of data outside the EEA).</p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information in support of our Services and their functions are: data analytics vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, and document hosting and support services providers. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by Connect Media Networks. You may have the right to opt out of having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set forth in this services privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure to Public Authorities</strong>. We are required to disclose the information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>

In cases where we are acting as a service provider to our customers, we are a data processor, and we do not directly control any personal data, so any changes or inaccuracies in the data we collect should be addressed to the businesses that are the controllers of such data. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.</p>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>

If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to and processed in the US.

        <p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
